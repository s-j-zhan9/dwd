  <div class="column" style="background-color:#111;">Hello, I’m S.J. Currently studying at NYU-ITP, I use a variety of communication technologies to explore new approaches of human-computer interaction. Outside of school, I recently created a new design system for driveway sharing startup ParkAmigo.</div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#222;">Prior to my master study, I led the redesign of eyewear company Illesteva’s e-commerce platform. I study the concept “Design” at large. I start my mornings reading industrial design news and every Friday I participate in online branding critiques. As an enthusiast of 20th-century design history, I frequently visit architecture and interior case studies when I travel. </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#111;">Now based in New York, I was raised in Shanghai and have lived in Paris and London. I started documenting my travels in 2014 and have traveled to numerous cities in over 20 countries since. Once an amateur photographer, I showcase my travel photographies on Instagram @woandworld.</div>
